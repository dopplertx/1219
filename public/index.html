<h1>What does 12:19 look like to you? </h1>

<p>We're inviting you to chronicle a single minute of your life, 12:19 
to 12:20pm, on any day of your choosing.</p>   

<p>What in particular do you notice?  For instance: a group of women 
wearing high heels, or the pattern of cream entering coffee, or the 
musical phrasing of car horns, etc.  <strong>What you record and how you 
record it is up to you!</strong>  Make some sort of image....a photo, a 
video, an audio file, a text file, a map,  whatever you like.  It's 
your observation, it's your minute--<strong>a map of your own 
discovery.</strong></p>   
<p>
Maybe you'll simply make a record of what you did--a webcam video 
of you typing <strong>an email</strong>, or the text of the email 
itself, or a <strong>photo</strong> of the lips you kissed, or a map showing the path where you walked your 
dog.  Or maybe, instead, you'll map your observations of the world 
during that minute: Taking photos of everybody who walks by you with red 
shoes, or <strong>recording</strong> the ambient noise in your local 
coffee shop, or producing a <strong>video</strong> montage of 12 cable 
newscasts, etc. 
</p>
<p>
We'll store your Minute here, along with Minutes of people around 
the world. The resulting "library" provides an opportunity to peer 
into a thousand lives.  To find <strong>connections</strong> and draw 
distinctions.  To 
discover extraordinary insights in ordinary moments.  To catch a glimpse 
of the infinite in the finite--the universe on the tip of a pin.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>The 12:19 Library</strong> will both exist online and in real 
space, premiering at the Austin Museum of Art in April 2009 as part of the Fuse Box 
Festival.</p>   
<p>
We hope you join us!
